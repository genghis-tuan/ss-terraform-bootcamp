# AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) Developer Guide

AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud-based service that simplifies the management of multiple AWS accounts and applications. SSO provides a single user sign-in experience across all accounts and applications, which enhances security and compliance and reduces the time and effort required to manage user access.

In this guide, we will cover the following topics:

1. Setting up AWS SSO
2. Configuring AWS SSO
3. Using AWS SSO with Applications
4. Best Practices for AWS SSO

## 1\. Setting up AWS SSO

To set up AWS SSO, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS SSO console.
2. Choose "Get started".
3. Choose "Create your identity source".
4. Choose your identity source, such as AWS Directory Service, Azure AD, or Okta.
5. Configure your identity source, such as adding users and groups.
6. Choose "Create your AWS SSO instance".
7. Choose a region and name for your SSO instance.
8. Assign users and groups to the instance.

## 2\. Configuring AWS SSO

To configure AWS SSO, follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS SSO console.
2. Choose "AWS accounts" or "Applications".
3. Choose "Add a new AWS account" or "Add a new application".
4. Enter the required information, such as the account ID or application URL.
5. Choose the SSO instance and assign access to users and groups.
6. Review and confirm the settings.

## 3\. Using AWS SSO with Applications

AWS SSO can be used with various applications, such as:

* AWS Management Console for accessing AWS resources.
* Custom web and mobile applications.
* Third-party software as a service (SaaS) applications.

To use AWS SSO with applications, you can:

* Enable SSO integration with the application, either by configuring SAML or OIDC integration or using a pre-built integration.
* Grant users and groups access to the application in AWS SSO.
* Monitor and manage user access to the application using AWS SSO.

## 4\. Best Practices for AWS SSO

To ensure the security and compliance of your AWS SSO configuration, follow these best practices:

* Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users and groups.
* Use groups to manage access to AWS accounts and applications.
* Use policies to manage permissions and access to AWS resources.
* Audit and monitor user activity using AWS CloudTrail.
* Regularly review and update your AWS SSO configuration to ensure it aligns with your organization's security and compliance requirements.
