# Git and GitHub Basics

This is a drill to help you or your students learn the basics of Git and GitHub. It is based on the [Git and GitHub Basics](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on GitHub Learning Lab.

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your source code over time. With Git, you can:

* Save different versions of your code, and switch between them easily
* Collaborate with other developers on the same codebase, and merge your changes together
* Roll back to a previous version of your code if something goes wrong
* Keep a history of who changed what, and when

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface to create, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories, as well as features such as:

* Pull requests and code reviews for collaborative development
* Issue tracking and project management tools
* Hosting for documentation and websites
* Integration with third-party tools, such as continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

## Git Workflow

Git has a basic workflow that you should follow when working on a project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Make your changes: edit files, add new files, delete files, etc.
4. Stage your changes: `git add .`
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Added feature X"`
6. Push your branch to the remote repository: `git push -u origin my-feature`
7. Open a pull request on GitHub and ask for feedback and review from your team
8. Merge the pull request into the main branch when you are satisfied with the changes

## Git Commands

Here are some basic Git commands that you'll use frequently:

* `git init`: create a new Git repository
* `git clone`: clone a remote Git repository
* `git status`: show the status of your repository and any changes that need to be committed
* `git add`: stage changes to be committed
* `git commit`: save changes to your local repository with a message
* `git push`: push your changes to a remote repository
* `git pull`: fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch
* `git branch`: list, create, or delete branches
* `git checkout`: switch to a different branch
* `git merge`: combine changes from two branches
* `git log`: show the commit history of your repository

## GitHub Features

Here are some basic GitHub features that you'll use frequently:

* Creating a new repository: log in to GitHub, click on the "+" button in the top-right corner, and choose "New repository"
* Creating a pull request: go to your repository on GitHub, click on the "Pull requests" tab, and click on "New pull request"
* Reviewing changes: use the "Files changed" tab on a pull request to review and comment on code changes
* Closing an issue: add a commit message that references the issue number (e.g., "Fixed #123"), and GitHub will automatically close the issue when the commit is merged

That's it! I hope this drill helps you or your students learn the basics of Git and GitHub. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
