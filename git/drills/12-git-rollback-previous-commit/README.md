# Scenario: Rollback to a Previous Commit

As a member of a development team using Git, you may need to rollback to a previous commit in your repository. This can be useful if you need to undo changes that have been made, or if a commit introduces a bug that needs to be fixed.

## Steps to Rollback to a Previous Commit

1. Determine the commit hash of the previous commit that you want to rollback to. You can use the `git log` command to view the commit history and find the hash.

    `git log`

2. Create a new branch to rollback to the previous commit. This keeps the main branch clean and makes it easy to undo the rollback if necessary.

    `git checkout -b rollback-<commit-hash>`

3. Reset the repository to the previous commit using the `git reset` command. This moves the HEAD to the specified commit, effectively undoing all the changes made after that commit.

    `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`

4. Review the changes made by the rollback and ensure that they are correct.
5. Push the changes to the remote branch using the `git push` command.

    `git push -f origin <rollback-branch-name>`

## Best Practices for Rolling Back to a Previous Commit

* Keep the main branch clean and create a new branch for the rollback.
* Use descriptive branch and commit messages that clearly explain the reason for the rollback.
* Communicate with other team members to ensure that everyone is aware of the rollback and any impact it may have on the project.

By following these steps and best practices, you can successfully rollback to a previous commit and maintain the integrity of your team's Git workflow.
