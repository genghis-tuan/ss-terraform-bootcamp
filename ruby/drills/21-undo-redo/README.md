# Undo/Redo System in Ruby: A Hands-on Guide to Understanding Stack Data Structures

Welcome to this hands-on guide, where we'll explore the stack data structure by building a simple undo/redo system in Ruby! By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of stacks and how to implement them to create practical applications.

## Introduction

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means the last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. This makes stacks perfect for implementing undo/redo systems, as the most recent action can easily be reverted or reapplied.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of building an undo/redo system using Ruby, and we'll also explain how stack data structures work along the way. The system we'll build can be easily extended and adapted for various applications, from text editors to image manipulation software.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of the Ruby programming language. Familiarity with data structures and algorithms is helpful but not required.

### Outline

1. **Getting Started**: Setting up our Ruby environment and initializing our undo/redo system.
2. **Understanding Stacks**: Learn about the stack data structure, its properties, and methods.
3. **Implementing a Stack in Ruby**: Create a custom stack class in Ruby to handle our undo/redo actions.
4. **Building the Undo/Redo System**: Add methods for performing, undoing, and redoing actions in our system.
5. **Testing and Usage**: Test our undo/redo system with some examples and learn how to integrate it into other projects.
6. **Conclusion**: Recap the key concepts and explore further resources to continue learning about stacks and undo/redo systems.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure that you have Ruby installed on your system. If you don't already have it, you can download and install Ruby from the [official website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Then, create a new file called `undo_redo_system.rb` to hold our code.

```bash
mkdir undo_redo_tutorial
cd undo_redo_tutorial
touch undo_redo_system.rb
```

Open `undo_redo_system.rb` in your favorite text editor and let's get started!

## Understanding Stacks

A stack is a data structure that stores elements in a linear fashion, where elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack. The main operations that can be performed on a stack are:

* `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
* `pop`: Remove the top element from the stack and return its value.
* `peek`: Get the value of the top element without removing it from the stack.
* `is_empty?`: Check if the stack is empty or not.

These operations ensure that the stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, making it ideal for managing undo/redo actions.

## Implementing a Stack in Ruby

Now that we understand the basics of stacks, let's create a custom stack class in Ruby.

```ruby
class Stack
  def initialize
    @elements = []
  end

  def push(element)
    @elements.push(element)
  end

  def pop
    @elements.pop
  end

  def peek
    @elements.last
  end

  def is_empty?
    @elements.empty?
  end
end
```

This simple class provides the essential stack operations we need for our undo/redo system.

## Building the Undo/Redo System

With our stack class in place, let's build the undo/redo system. We'll use two stacks: one for undo actions and one for redo actions.

```ruby
class UndoRedoSystem
  def initialize
    @undo_stack = Stack.new
    @redo_stack = Stack.new
  end

  def perform_action(action)
    @undo_stack.push(action)
    @redo_stack = Stack.new
  end

  def undo
    return if @undo_stack.is_empty?

    action = @undo_stack.pop
    @redo_stack.push(action)
  end

  def redo
    return if @redo_stack.is_empty?

    action = @redo_stack.pop
    @undo_stack.push(action)
  end
end
```

This class provides methods for performing, undoing, and redoing actions using the stack data structure.

## Testing and Usage

Let's test our undo/redo system with some examples. We'll use simple strings as actions for demonstration purposes, but you can adapt the system for any data type or operation you need.

```ruby
system = UndoRedoSystem.new

system.perform_action("Action 1")
system.perform_action("Action 2")
system.perform_action("Action 3")

puts "Undoing: #{system.undo}"
puts "Redoing: #{system.redo}"
```

This example performs three actions, undoes the last one, and then redoes it. When you run this code, you should see the following output:

```ruby
Undoing: Action 3
Redoing: Action 3
```

You can now integrate the undo/redo system into your own Ruby projects, customizing it to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've built an undo/redo system in Ruby while learning about stack data structures. We've seen how the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle of stacks makes them ideal for managing undo and redo actions in various applications.

To continue learning about stacks and their practical uses, you can explore additional resources on data structures and algorithms, such as textbooks, online courses, and coding exercises. Happy coding!
