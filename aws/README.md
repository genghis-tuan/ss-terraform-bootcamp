# AWS 101: An Introduction to Amazon Web Services for Developers

[drills](drills/README.md) | [test](#)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services for developers and businesses. It offers scalable and flexible cloud computing services, allowing you to build, deploy, and manage applications and infrastructure at any scale.

## Key AWS Services for Our Tech Stack

These are the key AWS services that we use for our tech stack. We will go into more detail about each service in the following sections.

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

EC2 is a web service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch virtual machines (instances) and configure the capacity and security of your instances. EC2 is a crucial service for running our applications, services, and software in the cloud.

### Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

S3 is an object storage service that provides industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is used for storing and retrieving any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere. S3 is a key service for storing our data, files, and backups in the cloud.

### Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

RDS is a managed database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database. RDS takes care of database administration tasks such as backups, patching, and scaling. It supports popular database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. RDS is essential for running our databases in the cloud.

### AWS Lambda

Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It allows you to run code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you. Lambda is a key service for building event-driven applications and serverless architectures.

### Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run, manage, and scale containerized applications in the cloud. ECS supports Docker containers and is integrated with other AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon VPC. ECS is essential for running our containerized applications in the cloud.

## Key AWS Tools and Resources for Our Tech Stack

These are the key AWS tools and resources that we use for our tech stack. We will go into more detail about each tool and resource in the following sections.

### AWS CloudFormation

CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications. You create a template that describes all the resources that you want, and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources.

### Amazon CloudWatch

CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS resources and applications. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated and authorized (allowed) to use resources.

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

ECR is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

### AWS CodeBuild

CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

### AWS CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as EC2, Lambda, and ECS.

### AWS CodePipeline

CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates.

### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

VPC is a service that lets you launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that
