# Basic Arithmetic

Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers and their properties. In this section, we'll cover the basics of arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Addition

Addition is the operation of combining two or more numbers to find their sum. The symbol used to represent addition is "+". For example, the sum of 2 and 3 is 5, which can be written as:

`2 + 3 = 5`

## Subtraction

Subtraction is the operation of finding the difference between two numbers. The symbol used to represent subtraction is "-". For example, the difference between 5 and 3 is 2, which can be written as:

`5 - 3 = 2`

## Multiplication

Multiplication is the operation of finding the product of two or more numbers. The symbol used to represent multiplication is "×" or "\*". For example, the product of 2 and 3 is 6, which can be written as:

`2 × 3 = 6`

## Division

Division is the operation of finding how many times one number goes into another number. The symbol used to represent division is "÷" or "/". For example, 6 divided by 3 is 2, which can be written as:

`6 ÷ 3 = 2`

## Order of Operations

When performing arithmetic operations, it's important to follow the correct order of operations to get the correct answer. The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses: Calculate expressions inside parentheses first.
2. Exponents: Calculate exponents (ie. powers).
3. Multiplication and Division: Calculate multiplication and division in order from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Calculate addition and subtraction in order from left to right.

For example, the expression "2 + 3 × 4" would be calculated as follows:

```bash
2 + 3 × 4
= 2 + 12  (multiplication first)
= 14      (addition)
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the basics of arithmetic is essential for many areas of mathematics and computer science, including programming. We hope this guide has given you a good introduction to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Remember to always follow the correct order of operations to get the correct answer. Happy calculating!
