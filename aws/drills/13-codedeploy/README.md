# AWS CodeDeploy Developer Guide

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and on-premises servers. CodeDeploy allows you to deploy code changes reliably and quickly, and provides detailed information about the deployment process and outcome.

In this guide, we will cover the following topics:

1. Setting up AWS CodeDeploy
2. Creating a Deployment Group
3. Configuring a Deployment
4. Managing a Deployment
5. Best Practices for AWS CodeDeploy

## 1\. Setting up AWS CodeDeploy

To set up AWS CodeDeploy, follow these steps:

1. Open the CodeDeploy console.
2. Choose "Create Application".
3. Enter a name for the application.
4. Choose the compute platform for the application.
5. Choose the deployment configuration for the application.
6. Review and create the application.

## 2\. Creating a Deployment Group

To create a deployment group, follow these steps:

1. Open the CodeDeploy console.
2. Choose the application for which you want to create a deployment group.
3. Choose "Create Deployment Group".
4. Enter a name for the deployment group.
5. Choose the deployment type, compute platform, and environment configuration.
6. Add or remove instances from the deployment group.
7. Review and create the deployment group.

## 3\. Configuring a Deployment

To configure a deployment, follow these steps:

1. Open the CodeDeploy console.
2. Choose the deployment group for which you want to configure a deployment.
3. Choose "Create Deployment".
